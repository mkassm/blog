Hi there <!--StartFragment-->üëãüèª<!--EndFragment-->! \
My name is **[Mohamed Kassem](https://www.kassm.me)**, a passionate software engineer specializing in full-stack projects. Welcome to my personal blog, where I share tech notes and articles, primarily focusing on .Net Technology, web development, and various software-related topics.

This blog serves as a platform where I share my experiences and insights. It's a place where I document challenges I've faced and showcase how I overcame them, with the hope of assisting others on similar journeys. You can also expect occasional rants about things that bother me, as well as posts about science, technology, programming, and graphics.

## About Me
I am well-versed in a diverse set of programming languages, including C#, Go Lang, TypeScript, and JavaScript. My expertise extends to Microsoft technologies such as .NET Core, ASP.NET MVC, APIs, and Blazor. I also have proficiency in crafting solutions with JavaScript and TypeScript, utilizing frameworks like Vue.js and Angular.

## Technology Stack
In my projects, I leverage various technologies and tools. My toolkit includes Docker for containerization, Elastic Search for efficient search functionality, Open Telemetry with Jaeger for observability, and OAuth2 with Keycloak and Identity Server for secure authentication. I am adept at working with databases such as Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and MySQL, utilizing ORMs like LLBLGen and Entity Framework Core.

## Skills
I excel in unit testing with xUnit and cover a wide range of concepts, including Algorithms, Data Structures, Microservices, CQRS Pattern, Web Security, and more. My proficiency extends to working with SOAP, gRPC, and RESTful APIs, ensuring effective and secure communication protocols for project success.
